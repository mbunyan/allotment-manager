# Allotments Manager

Experimental implementation of YII2 to provide management of Allotment Sites.

## What are allotments

Allotments are areas of arable land (sites) split into small units (plots) and rented to tenants by the land owner.

The tenant agrees T&C with land owner and rents a plot for up to one year, with option to renew on both parties.

A record is required to record and match plots with tenants, record compliance, record rent demands and payment.

## Mock data
